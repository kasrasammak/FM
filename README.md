Welcome to my segment of the doobverse.

This code is incomplete, it is purely to showcase my first programming work.

Worked on this segment of code in 2018 within the project of a friend.

KSound and KasraWindow - this was the code through which I learned Java and how to code.

Created an FM synth, helped work on the wav file reading and writing for performing manipulations.

Main.java is not mine, but there is an event which handles the class I created within it, as well as utilizes the wavfile functionality I helped work on.
